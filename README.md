# Titanic Dataset – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# Task Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand its structure, identify key patterns, and derive insights that could assist in future predictive modeling.

# Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for static visualizations

Plotly – for interactive plots

Google Colab – for code execution

# Dataset Source
Kaggle Titanic Dataset

# Steps Performed
Loaded the dataset using Pandas and explored the first few rows.

Checked data types and basic statistics using .info() and .describe().

Identified missing values and handled them using median and mode imputation.

Dropped irrelevant columns like Cabin due to too many missing values.

Visualized data using:

Histograms (Age distribution)

Boxplots (outliers)

Countplots (Survival by Sex and Class)

Correlation heatmap (numerical relationships)
